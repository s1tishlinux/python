# Python Object Reuse vs New Creation Chart

| Data Type & Code Example | Does Python reuse object? | Why | Non-Technical Explanation |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----|----------------------------|
| Integer (int)<br>a = 100<br>b = 100 | ✅ Yes | Python caches small integers from -5 to 256 in memory to save space and time. | Imagine numbers like 100 are stored once in a common place. Whenever you assign 100 again, Python reuses the same already-stored number to avoid waste. |
| Integer (int)<br>a = 1000<br>b = 1000 | ❌ No | Large integers (outside -5 to 256 range) are not cached; Python creates new objects each time. | Big numbers are not reused by default. Every time you type a large number, Python stores it separately like writing it again in a notebook. |
| String (str)<br>a = 'hello'<br>b = 'hello' | ✅ Yes (usually) | Python 'interns' some simple strings to save memory. Simple strings like 'hello' are reused. | If two people say the same simple word, like 'hello', Python remembers the first one and shares it instead of storing it twice. |
| String (str)<br>a = 'hello world! this is a long string'<br>b = 'hello world! this is a long string' | ❌ No (not always) | Longer or more complex strings are not always interned automatically. Python may create new objects. | If the sentence is big or complicated, Python may treat each version separately like writing it on two pages instead of reusing the same page. |
| List<br>x = [1, 2, 3]<br>y = [1, 2, 3] | ❌ No | Lists are mutable (changeable), so Python creates a new object every time to avoid accidental sharing. | Lists are like empty baskets you can add items into. Python gives each person a new basket so that adding to one doesn’t change the other’s basket. |
| Tuple<br>a = (1, 2, 3)<br>b = (1, 2, 3) | ✅ Sometimes | Tuples are immutable (unchangeable). Python may reuse them, especially if they contain only simple values. | Tuples are like sealed containers. If two people ask for the same sealed container, Python might give them the same one since it can’t be changed anyway. |
