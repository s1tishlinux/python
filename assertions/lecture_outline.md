# Python Assertions - Lecture Outline

## Introduction
- Overview of the topic
- Explain what assertions are: debugging aid that tests a condition
- Brief overview of when to use assertions vs. exceptions
- Mention that assertions can be disabled in production code

## Basic Assertion Syntax
- Show the basic syntax: `assert condition, optional_message`
- Demonstrate simple assertions with and without messages
- Show what happens when an assertion fails
- Explain the AssertionError exception

## Use Cases for Assertions
1. **Validating Function Inputs**
   - Preconditions checking
   - Type checking
   - Value range checking

2. **Debugging**
   - Verifying assumptions during development
   - Catching impossible conditions
   - Sanity checks

3. **Testing**
   - Simple test cases
   - Verifying expected outputs
   - Relationship to unit testing frameworks

4. **Documentation**
   - Assertions as executable documentation
   - Making assumptions explicit

## Assertions vs. Exceptions
- When to use assertions vs. exceptions
- Assertions are for programmer errors (bugs)
- Exceptions are for expected runtime errors
- Show examples of each approach

## Advanced Assertion Techniques
- Complex conditions in assertions
- Using helper functions in assertions
- Assertions with calculated values

## Best Practices
- Don't use assertions for data validation in production
- Include helpful error messages
- Don't use assertions with side effects
- Remember assertions can be disabled with -O flag

## Practical Examples
- Examples of assertions in action
- Demonstration of assertion failures and how to fix them

## Conclusion
- Recap key points about assertions
- Mention common pitfalls to avoid
- Suggest next topics to learn (unit testing, etc.)
